# Project: Review Classification System


## Project Description

This project is developed as part of the **Advanced Programming (INF395)** course.
It implements a **review classification system** using **machine learning** techniques.
The goal is to classify IMDB movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** based on their content.

The system uses the **Random Forest Classifier** from scikit-learn to train a sentiment analysis model.
A **Streamlit** web interface is developed to provide user interaction for real-time predictions.

## Problem Statement

The task is to classify movie reviews into two groups: positive or negative. This helps identify audience sentiment, which is valuable for movie studios, marketers, and content creators to adjust their strategies based on viewer opinions. Automating this sentiment analysis makes it possible to quickly analyze large numbers of reviews and understand how audiences feel about a film.

## Objectives

To accurately classify movie comments as positive or negative using machine learning models.
To provide a scalable solution for analyzing large volumes of movie reviews.
To generate insights into audience sentiment, helping movie studios and marketers understand public reception.
To enhance user experience by categorizing reviews, making it easier for viewers to navigate through feedback.
